/*This document contains notes and comments on 
  Sehoon's exchange strategy and code files, to 
  enable better understanding for integration
  phase. */

/*-----------bfs/enactor_multi_node.cuh-----------------------------*/
Sehoon's modifications can be found in the EnactSearch function from
lines 506 to ~920. Most of his modifications are after line 752 and
include exchanges for the neighbor queues.

/*-----------bfs/problem_type.cuh-----------------------------*/
Sehoon modified this file to scale up to 8 GPUs, but line 64
limits the max number of GPU partitions to 8.
//static const _VertexId LOG_MAX_GPUS   = 3;

/*-----------csr_graph.cuh-----------------------------*/
The sparse graph format has the following variables:

template<typename VertexId, typename Value, typename SizeT>
struct CsrGraph
{
 SizeT nodes;
 SizeT edges;

 SizeT     *row_offsets;
 VertexId  *column_indices;
 Value   *values;

 bool    pinned;
