To compile:
Make sure you have selected the right modules or set your PATH
and LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly.

You can use the compile script or call "make force64=1" directly.

Some scripts for running on Keeneland are included in the
keeneland_scripts directory. 

The "run_test_1gpu_cuda5_5.sh" script is just a stripped down
version of the full scripts in the scripts directory that can
be used to test basic functionality.
